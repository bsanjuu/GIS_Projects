The data in these files is obtained from Wellogic, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality Statewide Ground Water Database (SGWD).  Wellogic contains over 365,000 water well records found within the State of Michigan, although it cannot be considered a comprehensive or complete database of all the well records in existence.  
The level of completeness varies from county to county.

The locational information provided has varying degrees of accuracy, ranging from GPS point collection, map interpolation and digitizing, to address matching.  Refer to the metadata provided on X Y attributes to determine each individual record’s locational accuracy.
